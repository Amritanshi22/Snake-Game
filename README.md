The Snake Game in Python can be developed using Pygame, incorporating both arrow key controls for manual movement and BFS (Breadth-First Search) pathfinding for autonomous play. The game features a snake navigating a grid, growing as it consumes food while avoiding collisions with itself and the walls. Players can steer the snake using arrow keys, but when no input is given, BFS calculates the shortest path to the food for efficient movement. If a direct path is unavailable, BFS assists in making safe moves to extend survival. This blend of manual control and AI-driven pathfinding creates a dynamic and engaging gameplay experience.
